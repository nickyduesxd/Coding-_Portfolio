# Coding_Portfolio

Welcome!

I am Nick and this repository holds my coding portfolio from various labs and projects in my time as an Undergraduate Computer Science Major at the United States Naval Academy.

I have experience coding in the following languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Pony, CUDA, and OpenMP.

Each coding project I chose to showcase in this repositary has an attached README file that dictates the assignment overview.

Thank you for your time.
