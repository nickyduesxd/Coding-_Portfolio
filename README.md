# Coding Portfolio

Welcome!

I am Nick and this repository holds my coding portfolio from various labs and projects in my time as an Undergraduate Computer Science Major at the United States Naval Academy.

I have experience coding in the following languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Pony, CUDA, Scheme, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

My intellectual pursuits are deeply rooted in the realms of machine learning, advanced algorithms, and parallel computing, where I seek to explore the intersection of computational theory and practical innovation.

Thank you for your time.
