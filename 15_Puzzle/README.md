The 15-Puzzle is the obvious extension of the 8-Puzzle to a 4 by 4 grid. Here is the wikipedia article. Your task is to write a python program to enable a player to solve the the 15-puzzle using A*. Your primary A* function will be called aStar, and it will take a board and a heuristic function as argument and return a tuple of the moves to solve it, and the number of nodes expanded, as in: [[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[0,1],[0,0]]. and 154.  You must name the manhattan distance heuristic manhattanDistance and your misplaced tiles heuristic misplacedTiles.

When developing the code, use can use any main you like, but the submission system will test you code with this code here.

Submited files should be named:
astar.py
idastar.py
Board.py
PriQue.py (if you did not use one of the built in versions)
For the language, you must use python 3.
